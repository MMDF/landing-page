                    <li> Our service providers as listed in 8.3 and 8.7. 8.10 We use the services of Facebook Ireland
                        Limited
                        (Facebook) to carry out certain marketing activities on the Facebook Platform. Specifically,
                        from time
                        to time we use Facebook’s Audience Insights to help us to create targeted audiences for our
                        advertising
                        campaigns on Facebook. This involves sharing some of our customer personal data with Facebook to
                        allow
                        it to create for us information on the types of audiences (i.e. potential customers) on Facebook
                        platform that would be best suited to see our adverts. In this respect Facebook acts as our
                        joint
                        processor. For such processing of your personal data we and Facebook also act as a ‘Joint
                        Controller’
                        this means that both Facebook and us can determine the reasons for processing of your personal
                        data.
                        Facebook has its own privacy policy on how Facebook processes personal data, including the legal
                        basis
                        which Facebook relies on and the ways to exercise Data Subject rights against Facebook. To
                        review
                        Facebook’s privacy policy, you can visit: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy. You can also
                        obtain
                        full contact details of Facebook or its representative and the details of its Data Protection
                        Officer
                        from this policy. In order to ensure the rights of data subjects (i.e. you) we have entered into
                        a
                        Controller Addendum with Facebook that sets outs each parties’ respective responsibilities in
                        terms of
                        this processing and our responsibility to inform you of the details in this section 9.10. Any
