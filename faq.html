                    <p>In order to determine what solution is the best option for you, we will need to conduct an
                        assessment of your
                        current circumstances, including your income and expenses. To make the assessment as
                        straightforward as
                        possible, we recommend getting together details of your income (i.e. any benefits you receive, a
                        monthly/weekly
                        salary), details of what you owe to which companies, and your regular expenses. For your
                        expenses, you can use
                        your bank statements for the last three months to calculate what you're paying for items like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>utility bills</li>
                        <li>rent/mortgage</li>
                        <li>travel costs</li>
                        <li>food and toiletries</li>
                        <li>childcare</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We understand that most people will want a debt solution that will mean staying in their home.
                        There are several
                        debt solutions that won't affect assets such as your home and any equity it may have. If you're
                        insolvent and
                        can't afford to repay your debts in a reasonable time, some of the debt solutions available
                        might require you to
                        sell your home, remortgage or release some of the equity, depending on your individual
                        situation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, during your debt advice session you'll be told about the risks associated with each
                        available debt
                        solution, so you can make an informed choice that's right for your situation.</p>

                    <h2>Is a DMP suitable for me?</h2>
                    <p>A DMP may be a suitable debt solution if you have some surplus money available each month once
                        you've paid your
                        priority costs such as rent or mortgage, food, accommodation and utility bills.</p>

                        creditors.</p>

                    <h2>Does a DMP affect my credit file?</h2>
                    <p>A debt management plan will almost always affect your credit file and score. This is because you
                        usually pay less
                        than the minimum repayment amount you agreed to when you initially took the debts out.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A DMP isn't specifically registered on your credit file but the reduced payments could impact on
                        a few different
                        areas
                        of your credit file. Details of court action, defaults or missed payments will be removed six
                        years from the
                        date it
                        happened, even if the debt hasn't been fully repaid.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qna">
                    <h2>What debts can be included on a DMP?</h2>
                    <p>If you're unable to keep up with payments to most credit facilities, you should be able to
                        include these in your
                        DMP.
                        This includes credit cards, loans, overdrafts, catalogue accounts, payday loans and xxx. In some
                        circumstances,
                        you may
                        also be able to include any arrears where you've fallen behind on your household bills, such as
                        utility bills,
                        Council
                        Tax or your rent.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If a debt cannot be included in the DMP for any reason (e.g. it's a secured debt), we will
                        include the amount you
                        need
                        to pay to the account in your monthly budget to make sure you can keep up with your payments.

                    <h2>Is a DMP the same as debt consolidation?</h2>
                    <p>Debt consolidation involves taking out a loan to repay all unsecured debts you may have. Usually
                        the loan would
                        be paid
                        back over a longer period than the debts it was taken out to repay, therefore lowering the
                        monthly payments.
                        However,
                        interest is usually charged.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A debt management plan doesn't involve taking further credit. Instead, new payment terms are
                        agreed with your
                        creditor,
                        based on what you can afford to pay.</p>

                        not the full

                        not to go

                        will be
                        affected, but in our experience most jobs are not.</p>

                    <p>
                        A DRO costs £90, which is the amount charged by the Insolvency Service to process an
                        application. You can't get
                        any
                        discounts or exemptions like you can with bankruptcy fees, so the full £90 needs to be paid
                        before your
                        application can
                        be submitted. The fee can be paid in one lump sum or, if you live in England or Wales, in
                        installments over a
                        six-month
                        period. Once your fee has been paid and your application is submitted, you can't get your money
                        back, even if
                        the DRO is
                        rejected or revoked.
