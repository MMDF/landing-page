                    <p  class="display-none">In order to determine what solution is the best option for you, we will need to conduct an
                        assessment of your
                        current circumstances, including your income and expenses. To make the assessment as
                        straightforward as
                        possible, we recommend getting the details of your income together (i.e. any benefits you receive, a
                        monthly/weekly
                        salary), details of what you owe to which companies, and your regular expenses. For your
                        expenses, you can use
                        your bank statements for the last three months to calculate what you're paying for items like:

                        There are several
                        debt solutions that won't affect assets such as your home and any equity it may have. If you're
                        insolvent and
                        can't afford to repay your debts in a reasonable time, some of the debt solutions available
                        might require you to
                        sell your home, remortgage or release some of the equity, depending on your individual
                        situation.</p>
                    <br class="display-none">
                    <p  class="display-none">However, during your debt advice session you'll be told about the risks associated with each
                        available debt
                        solution, so you can make an informed choice that's right for your situation.</p>

                    <p  class="display-none">A DMP may be a suitable debt solution if you have some surplus money available each month once
                        you've paid your
                        priority costs such as rent or mortgage, food, accommodation and utility bills.</p>

                        will go to your

                    <p  class="display-none">A debt management plan will almost always affect your credit file and score. This is because you
                        usually pay less
                        than the minimum repayment amount you agreed to when you initially took the debts out.</p>
                    <p  class="display-none">A DMP isn't specifically registered on your credit file but the reduced payments could impact on
                        a few different
                        areas
                        of your credit file. Details of court action, defaults or missed payments will be removed six
                        years from the
                        date it
                        happened, even if the debt hasn't been fully repaid.</p>

                    <h2 class="bg-gradient-primary-to-secondary p-3 text-white">What debts can be included on a DMP?</h2>
                    <p class="display-none">If you're unable to keep up with payments to most credit facilities, you should be able to
                        include these in your
                        DMP.
                        This includes credit cards, loans, overdrafts, catalogue accounts, payday loans and xxx. In some
                        circumstances,
                        you may
                        also be able to include any arrears where you've fallen behind on your household bills, such as
                        utility bills,
                        Council
                        Tax or your rent.</p>
                    <p class="display-none">If a debt cannot be included in the DMP for any reason (e.g. it's a secured debt), we will
                        include the amount you
                        need
                        to pay to the account in your monthly budget to make sure you can keep up with your payments.

                    <h2 class="bg-gradient-primary-to-secondary p-3 text-white">Is a DMP the same as debt consolidation?</h2>
                    <p class="display-none">Debt consolidation involves taking out a loan to repay all unsecured debts you may have. Usually
                        the loan would
                        be paid
                        back over a longer period than the debts it was taken out to repay, therefore lowering the
                        monthly payments.
                        However,
                        interest is usually charged.</p>
                    <p class="display-none">A debt management plan doesn't involve taking further credit. Instead, new payment terms are
                        agreed with your
                        creditor,
                        based on what you can afford to pay.</p>

                    <p class="display-none">An individual voluntary arrangement is a type of insolvency and a legally binding arrangement between you and your creditors. It may be a suitable solution if you can afford to pay something to your debts, but not the full amount your creditors want.</p>
                    <p class="display-none">If you have a lump sum to pay towards your debts, you may also qualify for an IVA.</p>
                    <p class="display-none">An IVA should be carefully considered because of the possible consequences for your personal, professional and financial life. There are several risks that you must consider before applying which is why you should get expert debt advice.</p>

                    <h2 class="bg-gradient-primary-to-secondary p-3 text-white">Does an IVA affect my credit file?</h2>
                    <p class="display-none">IVA's are a type of insolvency and will show on your credit file for six years from the date they begin. During this time, you're likely to find it difficult to obtain credit. You must also inform your insolvency practitioner (IP) and get written permission if you want to take out more than £500 worth of credit during your IVA. Details of individual voluntary arrangements are listed on a public register called the Individual Insolvency Register. It's unlikely that anyone would come across this information, but it's something which is available to those who know where to look for it.</p>

                    <h2 class="bg-gradient-primary-to-secondary p-3 text-white">What costs and fees are involved?</h2>
                    <p class="display-none">No matter who arranges your IVA there are associated costs and fees. Our Partners IVA costs and fees follow industry standards. All fees are agreed by you and your creditors before an IVA is approved. If at any time you decidenot to go ahead with an IVA with us, there will be no fees to pay.
                    </p>
                    <p class="display-none">
                        Other IVA companies may charge different fees. It's important to check and understand them
                        before going ahead.

                    <p class="display-none">Some jobs could be affected if you're on an IVA, for example:</p>
                    <ul class="display-none">
                        <li>Company directors</li>

                        <li>Pub licensees</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="display-none">The best way to find out if an IVA or bankruptcy would impact on your job is to check with your professional membership body or trade union or ask to speak to your HR department confidentially. It's important to check if your job will be affected, but in our experience most jobs are not.</p>

                        A debt relief order will stay on your credit file for six years from the date it's approved. This may make it difficult to take out credit during this time.

                    <p  class="display-none">
                        A DRO costs £90, which is the amount charged by the Insolvency Service to process an
                        application. You can't get
                        any
                        discounts or exemptions like you can with bankruptcy fees, so the full £90 needs to be paid
                        before your
                        application can
                        be submitted. The fee can be paid in one lump sum or, if you live in England or Wales, in
                        installments over a
                        six-month
                        period. Once your fee has been paid and your application is submitted, you can't get your money
                        back, even if
                        the DRO is
                        rejected or revoked.
